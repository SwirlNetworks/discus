Discus
======
Discus is a series of convenience and safety extensions on BackBone, along with some optional opinionated design paterns.

Features
======
* View parenting with garbage collection
* Automatic template rendering with template data helper methods
* State driven template selection
* Automatic child view attachment by selector
* Advanced ListView
  * Asyncronous rendering for responsiveness
  * Sparse view rendering for massive data sets
* Convenience methods
* Warnings on missed paterns, like unparented subviews or double removing views


Purpose
======
Discus is designed to be somewhere between the heavy handed framework of Marionette and the near unusable genericness of BackBone. Discus aims to bring a bit of structure needed for scaling pure BackBone apps in to massive applications. It focuses on DRYing out repeat paterns, garbage collection, developer convenience and developer safety.
